# Advanced Filter

[Elliot](https://github.com/lukasheinz92/elliot/blob/main/README.md#elliot)

Instructions:

1. Select any cell in a column of the table you want to filter.
2. Type or copy-paste values you want to filter into the text field (filter is not case sensitive).
3. Every value has to be on a new row (default) or separated by a delimiter. Choose your delimiter in the right section of the window. You can use preset delimiter or "Other" option with custom delimiter (custom delimiter may contain one or more characters, even numbers).
4. Empty rows at the bottom are ignored, else they are part of values to filter.
5. Spaces between single values and delimiters (even row delimiter) are trimmed.
6. Check "Keep Filter Open" if you want to keep the window open after filtering.

Error may occur primarily when:
- selected cell is out of the table
- invalid characters are entered into the Filter Criteria window
- you are trying to filter pivot table
